# CLAUDE CODE STARTER PROMPT
# Men's Clothing E-Commerce Platform

Copy and paste this entire prompt into Claude Code terminal to start building.

================================================================================

Build a complete men's clothing e-commerce platform with admin panel that helps an established offline men's clothing store owner expand online and reach customers nationally across India.

## TARGET USER
- **Primary:** Indian customers (18-45 years) looking to buy men's clothing online
- **Secondary:** Store owner (Naveen) with existing offline inventory who needs to manage products and orders

## THE ONE PROBLEM IT SOLVES
Customers cannot browse and buy from the comprehensive offline store inventory online, limiting business to walk-in customers only.

## TECH STACK
- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (App Router with TypeScript)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Payments:** Razorpay (UPI, Cards, NetBanking, Wallets)
- **Image Storage:** Supabase Storage
- **Deployment:** Vercel (free tier)
- **State Management:** React Context API for cart

## CORE USER LOOPS

### Customer Loop (3 steps):
1. **Browse** → View products by category, search, filter
2. **Add to Cart** → Select size, add items, review cart
3. **Checkout** → Enter address, choose COD or pay online, get order confirmation

### Admin Loop (3 steps):
1. **Add Products** → Upload product with images, prices, sizes, stock levels
2. **Manage Orders** → View new orders, update status (pending → processing → shipped → delivered)
3. **Track Inventory** → Monitor stock levels, get low stock alerts

## EXPLICITLY DO NOT INCLUDE

❌ Customer user accounts and authentication (guest checkout only for MVP)
❌ Wishlist functionality
❌ Product reviews and ratings
❌ Email/SMS notifications (add after launch)
❌ Advanced search with AI/ML
❌ Recommendation engine
❌ Discount codes system
❌ Loyalty program
❌ Blog or content management
❌ Social media integration
❌ Live chat
❌ Return management (handle manually for MVP)
❌ Analytics dashboard (use Vercel analytics)
❌ Multi-currency
❌ Internationalization

**Why skip these:** We need to validate that people will buy first. Add these features AFTER getting first 20 orders and based on customer requests. Every extra feature delays launch and learning.

## SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

### Indian Market Specifics:
- **COD is CRITICAL** - Most first-time online buyers prefer COD
- COD max order: ₹10,000 (configurable)
- Free shipping above ₹999, else ₹99 flat charge
- All prices inclusive of taxes
- Pin code validation for shipping

### Categories & Products:
- 8 main categories (listed above)
- Each product can have multiple sizes
- Track stock per size (e.g., M size: 10 units, L size: 15 units)
- Products can have up to 5 images
- Use placeholder images initially (owner will replace with actual photos)

### Order Workflow:
Customer places order → Admin gets notification → Admin updates status:
1. Pending (just placed)
2. Processing (preparing order)
3. Shipped (dispatched with tracking)
4. Delivered (marked complete)
5. Cancelled (if needed)

### Size Standards:
- T-Shirts/Shirts/Jackets: S, M, L, XL, XXL, XXXL
- Pants/Jeans/Trousers: 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42
- Accessories: One Size or specific options

### Razorpay Integration Steps:
1. Create Razorpay account (Test mode for development)
2. Install razorpay npm package
3. Create order on backend before payment
4. Show Razorpay checkout modal on frontend
5. Verify payment signature on backend via webhook
6. Update order status based on payment
7. Handle failed payments gracefully

### Mobile-First Design:
- All features MUST work perfectly on mobile
- Touch-friendly buttons (min 44px height)
- Easy thumb navigation
- Fast loading (images optimized)
- Cart icon always visible in header

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

**This MVP is successful when:**
- Store owner can add 50+ products with images
- Customer can browse, add to cart, checkout with COD or online payment
- Order appears in admin panel immediately
- Owner can update order status
- Complete purchase flow works on mobile
- Page loads in < 2 seconds
- Zero critical bugs

**We'll know it works when:**
- First 5 orders completed successfully
- Owner can manage orders without help
- Customers don't need support to checkout
- Mobile experience is smooth

## DEVELOPMENT PRIORITIES

**Week 1 (Days 1-7):**
1. Setup: Next.js + Supabase + Tailwind
2. Database schema setup
3. Homepage with category navigation
4. Product listing pages
5. Product detail page
6. Shopping cart functionality

**Week 2 (Days 8-14):**
7. Checkout flow (guest checkout)
8. Razorpay integration + COD option
9. Basic admin panel
10. Product management (CRUD)
11. Order management
12. Deploy to Vercel

## FOCUS ON SHIPPING

- Build the minimum that lets customers buy and owner manage orders
- Placeholder product images are fine (owner will replace)
- Basic design is fine (can improve after launch)
- Don't add features "just in case" - add them when customers ask
- Deploy to Vercel as soon as core loop works
- Get real feedback from first customers, then iterate

## IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **Use Supabase Storage** for product images (1GB free)
2. **Order number format:** ORD-YYYYMMDD-XXXX (e.g., ORD-20251120-0001)
3. **Cart state:** Use Context API, persist in localStorage
4. **Admin auth:** Simple email/password (use bcrypt for hashing)
5. **Error handling:** Show user-friendly messages, log errors
6. **Loading states:** Show spinners during API calls
7. **Form validation:** Use React Hook Form + Zod

## AFTER MVP SHIPS

Once we have 10-20 real orders, add features based on customer feedback:
- User accounts (if customers request login)
- Email notifications
- Wishlist (if customers ask)
- Product reviews
- Discount codes
- Better analytics

**Ship first, validate, then iterate. Don't build features nobody asks for.**
